# LazyExperienceSection Documentation

## Purpose

`LazyExperienceSection` is a React component designed to **lazy-load user experiences** only when the section becomes visible in the viewport. This prevents unnecessary API calls, optimizes performance, and provides a smooth loading fallback (skeleton → data).

---

## Component Flow

1. **Initial Render**

   * Section mounts with a `ref` for intersection observation.
   * `loaded = false`, `loading = false`.
   * Shows `<LoadingState />` placeholder.

2. **Intersection Trigger**

   * When **25% of the section** is visible (`threshold: 0.25`), the `useIntersectionObserver` hook sets `hasBeenVisible = true`.

3. **Fetch Logic**

   * `fetchExperiences()` runs **only once**, guarded by:

     ```ts
     if (loaded || loading) return
     ```
   * `loading = true` → `<ExperienceSkeleton />` displayed.
   * API call → `experiencesAPI.getAllExperiences()`.
   * If success: `experiences` state is updated, `loaded = true`.
   * If failure: shows toast error.

4. **Final State**

   * `<ExperienceSection experiences={experiences} />` is rendered after load.
   * No overlap, no double-fetch.

---

## Key Fix for Overlap

Problem: On **page refresh**, `threshold: 0.05` caused the observer to trigger **too early**, racing the skeleton and the data UI.
Solution: Using `threshold: 0.25` ensures at least 25% of the section is visible before fetch starts, preventing race conditions and overlap.

---

## Component States

* **Idle (before scroll)**

  ```tsx
  <LoadingState />
  ```
* **Loading (after visible)**

  ```tsx
  <ExperienceSkeleton />
  ```
* **Loaded (success)**

  ```tsx
  <ExperienceSection experiences={experiences} />
  ```
* **Error (failure)**

  * Toast: `"Failed to load experiences"`

---

## API Dependency

`experiencesAPI.getAllExperiences()` must return:

```ts
{
  data: Experience[]
}
```

If the response is not an array, fallback is `[]`.

---

## Usage

```tsx
<LazyExperienceSection />
```

* Place inside your main page layout.
* Ensure it has `id="experience-section"` for anchor links.
