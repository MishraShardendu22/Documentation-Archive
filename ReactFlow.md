Here is a concise documentation for getting started with React Flow:

# React Flow Quick Docs

## What is React Flow?
React Flow is a React library to build node-based editors and interactive diagrams with draggable nodes and edges.

***

## Installation

```bash
npm install reactflow
```

***

## Core Concepts

- **Nodes:** Main objects in the diagram with an `id`, `position` (x, y), and `data` (e.g., label).
- **Edges:** Connections between nodes with an `id`, `source` node id, and `target` node id.

Example nodes and edges:

```js
const initialNodes = [
  { id: '1', position: { x: 200, y: 200 }, data: { label: 'Node 1' } },
  { id: '2', position: { x: 400, y: 200 }, data: { label: 'Node 2' } },
];

const initialEdges = [
  { id: 'e1-2', source: '1', target: '2' },
];
```

***

## Basic Usage

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import ReactFlow, { useNodesState, useEdgesState, Controls, MiniMap, Background } from 'reactflow';
import 'reactflow/dist/style.css';

function Flow() {
  const [nodes, setNodes, onNodesChange] = useNodesState(initialNodes);
  const [edges, setEdges, onEdgesChange] = useEdgesState(initialEdges);

  return (
    
      
        
        
        
      
    
  );
}

export default Flow;
```

***

## Features to Add

- **Controls:** Zoom, pan, and rotate controls.
- **MiniMap:** A minimap of your graph layout.
- **Background:** Grid/background for the workspace, customizable (dots, lines, crosses).

***

## Tips

- Keep your container sized; React Flow requires explicit width and height.
- Use `useNodesState` and `useEdgesState` hooks to handle state and changes easily.
- Customize nodes and edges by creating custom components if needed.

***

This summary covers starting with React Flow, adding nodes and edges, plus controls and basic UI elements for workflow diagrams.
