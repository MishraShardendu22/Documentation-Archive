**Why was Linux needed?**
Linux was created to provide a free, open-source, and customizable alternative to proprietary operating systems. Existing systems were expensive, closed-source, and restrictive. Linux allows users to study, modify, and distribute the source code, making it ideal for servers, developers, and large-scale systems.

**What is a File System in Linux?**
A file system is the method Linux uses to store, organize, and manage files on storage devices. Everything in Linux is treated as a file (including devices and processes). Files are organized in a single hierarchical tree starting from the root directory `/`.
